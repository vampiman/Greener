# Sprint 2: Review

## Main problems Encountered

- Problems related to the deployment of the Web Service to the Glassfish server due to different computer configurations of each member

- A lot of resources that had to be parsed before understanding and starting to employ the coding techniques

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - There were no previous sprints.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - More communication between the teams
 - Last week the code output wasn't that big due to the vast amount of research that had to be done -> increase code output
 - More test coverage
 - Start merging the code of each sub-team
 - Dividing work more evenly
 - Better work with the Issue feature
