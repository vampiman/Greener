## Personal Development Plan

![My Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47633984/52824096-96489b80-30b7-11e9-9a02-bd7a8cedf661.jpg)

Strong points:
- I am ambitious and in order to reach my goal I can study a lot
- When I have a task and I have promised to finish it, I finish it
- In a team, hard work and being aware of the responsibilities can be useful

Weaker Points:
- Sometimes, because of a high workload I can be stressed
- I don’t think this is going to have an effect on the team

### G-Goal
- Developing my java skills
- Learning how a group project works 
- Getting a good grade
These are important because developing my knowledge about java and learning how to work efficiently in a group are useful for my future education and career
I think I will achieve this goals at the end of this project because when I finish this project I am going to have an experience about group project and also hopefully I am going to learn a lot more about java

### R-Reality
This is my first project and we just started so I hope it goes well and adds a lot of things to me

### O-Options
The option I hope is finishing this project successfully and I think we are going to work efficiently as a group and at the end hopefully we will finish this project successfully with a good grade. 

### W-Will
- I am going to work a lot in order to reach my goal and I am going to start right now for this. The first step I can take is making a plan with my group mates and then starting our project according to this plan
- Action Plan:
-- Determining the things which we are going to do
-- Deciding important parts as a group (such as which libraries we are going to use etc.)
-- Distributing work equally to members and assigning a task to each group member
-- Starting to code
-- While everyone is working on their part, informing each other about our progress, also we need to be careful about the parts which are connected (two person’s task can be connected so they should act according to this otherwise it can lead a non-compiling code)
